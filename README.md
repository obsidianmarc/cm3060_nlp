Comparative Text Classification Using Statistical and Embedding-based Models

-	Using the “Emotions” dataset from Kaggle to explore the performance between statistical (SVM) and embedding-based (BiLSTM) models, specifically within mental health sentiment analysis
-	Identified scenarios where SVM or BiLSTM is better suited, such as resource-limited environments for SVM and complex contextual analysis for BiLSTM
-	Explored real-world applications in mental health monitoring, personalized therapy, and social media sentiment analysis
